# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Parqcel. A few guidelines to make contributions smooth:

- Fork the repository and open a feature branch.
- Run tests before submitting a PR: `py -3 -m pytest -q`.
- Follow formatting rules: run `ruff` and `black` (configs in `pyproject.toml`).
- For substantial changes, open an issue first to discuss designs.
- Be respectful and follow general community standards.

When opening a PR, include a short description of the change, and reference any relevant issue.
